American Amber Ale

tle Famil: Pale Ale

American Amber Ale

American-style amber ales have medium-high to high maltiness with medium to low caramel character. They are characterized by
American-variety hops, which produce medium hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. American ambers are usually darker in color,
have more caramel flavor and less hop aromatics, and may have more body. This style was first made popular by brewers from
California and the Pacific Northwest.

English-Style IPA

tle Famil: India Pale Ale

English-Style IPA

Steeped in lore (and extra hops), the IPA is a stronger version of a pale ale. Characterized by stiff English-style hop character
(earthy, floral) and increased alcohol content. English yeast lends a fruity flavor and aroma. Different from its American
counterpart, this style strikes a balance between malt and hops for a more rounded flavor. There is also a lot of mythology
surrounding the creation of this style, which is still debated today.

Berliner-Style Weisse

Low in alcohol and refreshingly tart, and often served with a flavored syrup like Woodruff or raspberry, this German-style wheat
ale presents a harmony between yeast and lactic acid. These beers are very pale in color, and may be cloudy as they are often
unfiltered. Hops are not a feature of this style, but these beers often do showcase esters. Traditional versions often showcase
Brettanomyces yeast. Growing in popularity in the U.S., where many brewers are now adding traditional and exotic fruits to the
recipe, resulting in flavorful finishes with striking, colorful hues. These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and
residual sugar are very low, allowing the beer’s acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine. Carbonation is very
high, adding to the refreshment factor this style delivers. Many examples of this style contain no hops and thus no bitterness at all.

German-style hefeweizens are straw to amber in color and made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. The aroma and flavor of a
weissbier comes largely from the yeast and is decidedly fruity (banana) and phenolic (clove). “Weizen” means “wheat” and “hefe”
means “yeast.” There are multiple variations to this style. Filtered versions are known as “Kristal Weizen” and darker versions are
referred to as “Dunkels,” with a stronger, bock-like version called “Weizenbock.” This is commonly a very highly carbonated style
with a long-lasting collar of foam.

The use of American hops in this ale lends to the perception of medium hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Coupled with a solid
malt profile, this should be a beer with balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Some breweries will choose to bottle-

American brewers taking an established style and boosting the flavor. California brewers are credited with creating this innovative
style.

Originally from the Düsseldorf area of Germany, these ales strike a balance between hop and malt flavors and aromas, but can
have low fruity esters and some peppery and floral hop aromas. Before Germany had lager beer, it had ales. Alt, meaning “old,”
pays homage to one rebel region in Germany which did not lean into lagering. U.S. producers celebrate the ale revolution
beautifully with this top-fermented German beer style.

Irish-Style Red

tle Famil: Hrid eer

Irish-Style Red

This is a balanced beer that uses a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley to give the color for which it’s named. With
a medium hop characteristic on the palate, this typically amber-colored beer is brewed as a lager or ale and can have a medium
candy-like caramel malt sweetness. This style may contain adjuncts such as corn, rice and sugar, which help dry out the finish and
lessen the body. It also often contains roasted barley, lending low roasted notes, darker color and possibly creating a tan collar of
foam. With notes of caramel, toffee and sometimes low-level diacetyl (butter), think of this beer style as a cousin to lightly-toasted
and buttered bread.

Robust Porter

tle Famil: Porter

Robust Porter

Often features more bitter and roasted malt flavor than a brown porter, but not quite as much as a stout. Robust porters have a
roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor. Their caramel and malty sweetness is in harmony with the
sharp bitterness of black malt. Hop bitterness is evident. With U.S. craft brewers doing so much experimentation in beer styles and
ingredients, the lines between certain stouts and porters are often blurred. Yet many deliberate examples of these styles do exist.
Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels.

Smoke Porter

Typically the base for this style is a robust porter that is given smoky depth thanks to wood-smoked malt. Traditionally, brewers

Sweet stout, also referred to as cream stout or milk stout, is black in color. Malt sweetness, chocolate and caramel should dominate
the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. It also should have a low to medium-low roasted malt/barley-derived bitterness.

Scottish-style ales vary depending on strength and flavor, but in general retain a malt-forward character with some degree of

Belgian-Style Flanders

Belgian-Style Flanders

An ale with character and balance, thanks to lactic sourness and acetic acid. Cherry-like flavors are acceptable, as is malt sweetness
that can lend bitterness and a cocoa-like character. Oak or other wood-like flavors may be present, even if the beer was not aged in
barrels. Overall, the style is characterized by slight to strong lactic sourness, and Flanders “reds” sometimes include a balanced
degree of acetic acid. Brettanomyces-produced flavors may be absent or very low. This style is a marvel in flavor complexity,
combining malt, yeast, microorganisms, acidity and low astringency from barrel aging.

Naturally and spontaneously fermented beers with high to very high levels of esters, plus bacterial and yeast-derived sourness that
sometimes includes acetic flavors. Lambics are not blended, while the gueuze style blends old and new lambics which are re-
fermented in the bottle. Historically, they are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt,
sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through the addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Many
examples of this style are made to resemble the gueuze lambic beers of the Brussels area, where it originated.

Bohemian-style pilseners have a slightly sweet and evident malt character and a toasted, biscuit-like, bready malt character. Hop
bitterness is perceived as medium with a low to medium-low level of noble-type hop aroma and flavor. This style originated in
1842, with “pilsener” originally indicating an appellation in the Czech Republic. Classic examples of this style used to be
conditioned in wooden tanks and had a less sharp hop bitterness despite the similar IBU ranges to German-style pilsener. Low-
level diacetyl is acceptable. Bohemian-style pilseners are darker in color and bigger in final gravity than their German
counterparts.

Barrel-Aged Beer

A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer, that has been
aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the unique
character of the wood and/or the flavor of what has previously been in the barrel. Today’s craft brewers are using wood (mostly
oak) to influence flavor and aromatics. Beer may be aged in wooden barrels (new or previously used to age wine or spirits), or
chips, spirals and cubes may be added to the conditioning tanks that normally house beer. A variety of types of wood are used
including oak, apple, alder, hickory and more. The interior of most barrels is charred or toasted to further enhance the flavor of the
wood.

Chocolate Beer

This is an ale or lager that benefits from the addition of dark chocolate or cocoa. More common in porters, stouts and brown ales,
where the grain bill better complements the confectionery ingredient, it can be added to other styles as well. Overt bitterness is not
acceptable in this style. Little hop character is desired and the chocolate flavor does not need to be overwhelming. The style can

Coffee Beer

As the name suggests, this can be either a lager or ale with coffee added to boost flavor. While stouts and porters are popular base
styles for coffee beer, many craft breweries are experimenting with other styles, like cream ales and India pale ales. Brewers may
steep the beans in either water or beer to impart java flavor without adding acidity. Barrel-aged or wood-influenced versions may
show signs of oxidation, including sherry notes and other advanced flavors.

honey to traditional styles. Overall the character of honey should be evident but not totally overwhelming. A wide variety of honey
beers are available. U.S. brewers may add honey to the boil kettle (as a sugar source) or post-boil (to preserve more volatile

Pumpkin Beer

One of the most popular seasonal beers, this is a lager or ale that is brewed with fresh or processed pumpkin or winter squash.
Since the fruit does not have much of a taste by itself, many craft brewers have taken to adding spices typically found in pumpkin
pie, like cinnamon and clove. However, these flavors should not overpower the final product. Pumpkin can be found in everything
from stouts to pale ales and pilseners.

Rye Beer

In darker versions, malt flavor can optionally include low roasted malt characters (evident as cocoa/chocolate or caramel) and/or
aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters. Low-level roasted malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with low
to medium malt sweetness. Hop flavor is low to medium-high. Hop bitterness is low to medium. These beers can be made using
either ale or lager yeast. The addition of rye to a beer can add a spicy or pumpernickel character to the flavor and finish. Color can
also be enhanced and may become more red from the use of rye. The ingredient has come into vogue in recent years in everything
from stouts to lagers, but is especially popular with craft brewers in India pale ales. To be considered an example of the style, the
grain bill should include sufficient rye such that rye character is evident in the beer.

Session Beer

This beer style is not defined by flavors or aromas, which can place it in almost any style category. Instead, what makes a session
beer is primarily refreshment and drinkability. Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style
guidelines. The goal should be to reach a balance between the style’s character and the lower alcohol content. Drinkability is a
factor in the overall balance of these beers. Beer should not exceed 5 percent ABV.

Smoke Beer

Smoke Beer

When malt is kilned over an open flame, the smoke flavor becomes infused into the beer, leaving a taste that can vary from dense
campfire, to slight wisps of smoke. This style is open to interpretation by individual brewers. Any style of beer can be smoked; the
goal is to reach a balance between the style’s character and the smoky properties. Originating in Germany as rauchbier, this style is
open to interpretation by U.S. craft brewers. Classic base styles include German-style Marzen/Oktoberfest, German-style bock,
German-style dunkel, Vienna-style lager and more. Smoke flavors dissipate over time.
