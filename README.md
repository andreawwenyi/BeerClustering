## Synopsis

This is 2 beer novices’ attempt to explore the world of (american) beer with data scientist’s approach (Hierarchical Clustering). 

## Data Source 
Beer Styles Study Guide (pdf) by Craftbeer.com (Published by Brewers Association). <br />
We used pdfminer (https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) to convert the pdf file into txt file, plus some manual changes to the txt file in order to correct some mistakes from the conversion as well as make the data processing easier. <br />
The final txt file is with name 'beerguide.txt' 
 
## Installation
This repository contains the original pdf, converted txt file ('beerguide.txt'), and the code ('CleanData_final.ipynb') to implement the clustering. <br />
The code include data cleaning, feature engineering, and the final modeling. <br />
In order to implement the code, please put both the txt file and Ipynb in the same directory. <br />
